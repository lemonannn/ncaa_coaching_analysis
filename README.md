# ncaa_coaching_analysis
This is a messy repo for my college football coaching analysis project. The most recent data is in the new_coach_hires_2019-25.csv file, and all of the analysis can be found in coach_analysis.ipynb. Any other files were tools used in the creation of the dataset. Credit to BoW Sports Analytics for compiling head coach history data that I utilized. You can find their dataset here: https://borderingonwisdom.wordpress.com/college-football-coach-database/.

There is one solid consideration that I've thought of to add upon this research aside from broadening the year range of the dataset. It would be interesting to see if coaches that had previously been an assistant coach under a premier head coach (ex. Brent Key being the offensive line coach at Alabama under Nick Saban from 2016-18) had a significantly higher success rate than the average hire. I might do this in the future, but it seemed slightly out of the range of my targets for this project and I want to finish this so I can get back to mock drafting. ;).

Of course, you could also expand the year range of the dataset, but every year means significnatly more work in filling in the nessessary data. For this project, I wanted to focus on the effects of the new transfer portal regulations and NIL funding, so 2019 seemed like a good initial hiring year to consider, even if it did leave me with relatively little data.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. Preferably, contact me on discord through the links on my website here: https://lemonannn.github.io/. If that's too much work, then just email me at lemonanman@gmail.com.
